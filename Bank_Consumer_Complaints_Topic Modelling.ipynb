I have NEVER been to North Carolina and I have NEVER been a resident. I have filed a dispute twice through my credit bureaus but both times BB & T has claimed that this is an accurate loan. Which I wasn't aware of until today. I have tried to contact BB & T multiple times but I have never gotten through to a live person. I do n't drive and I have never owned a car before. I didn't have any knowledge of this account until I checked XXXXXXXX XXXX  and noticed it. I've tried twice to dispute it. Additionally I never received any bills or information about this account.

       "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",

     I am XXXX XXXX and have been banking with Wells Fargo for decades. I wanted to refinance my home and decided to give them my business. My credit score is near 800 and my income is approx 400K annually. They pre-approved me and we began the process in XXXX of XXXX. After charging me for an appraisal and causing me to incur other expenses, the notified me in XX/XX/XXXX that i did not have the income to justify the loan, which is a flaw in their system. \\nI have since refinanced with XXXX with ZERO issues as they have confirmed my income as what is stated on my tax returns. \\n\\nI have asked Wells Fargo to refund my {$580.00} for the appraisal and {$250.00} for the subordination fee and they have refused my request. \\n\\nMy experience with them has been terrible. It blows my mind that they are willing to treat a customer such as myself this way - I have been there decades and have large deposits in my accounts. If they are deciding to treat small business owners this way, then perhaps small business owners should consider different banks.   \n",

But he said if it is not sent in, the packet would be considered incomplete. \\n\\nThe homeowner believes her consumer rights have been violated. She faithfully submitted the same documentation over and over again. A representative stated to the borrower and counselor that the lender will be receiving a subsidy to add to the loan from the government ; therefore the underwriters wanted to ensure the biggest return to modify the loan, if possible. The RMA application had to be resubmitted three times for no reason except that the lender is increasing the defaulted amount in order to receive a greater payment for loss mitigation operations. The loan modification could have been approved back in XXXX with the 1st submission by the HUD Approved Housing Counseling Agency. Therefore the homeowner is asking the loan modification PITI payment to be {$550.00} per month or less and for the loan to be restructured for 25 years with an interest rate fixed at 3.75 % with no balloon payment. And the lender should not receive any subsidy for lack of resolving the default expediently. \\n\\nAlso the lender served the homeowner with a SUMMONS on XX/XX/XXXX. When the homeowner made an inquiry to the lender, the lender could not answer the reason for the summons. The homeowner needs an explanation.   \n",

have been banking with wells fargo for decades. i wanted to refinance my home and decided to give them my business. my credit score is near 800 and my income is approx 400k annually. they pre-approved me and we began the process in xxxx of xxxx. after charging me for an appraisal and causing me to incur other expenses, the notified me in xx/xx/xxxx that i did not have the income to justify the loan, which is a flaw in their system. i have since refinanced with xxxx with zero issues as they have confirmed my income as what is stated on my tax returns. i have asked wells fargo to refund my {$580.00} for the appraisal and {$250.00} for the subordination fee and they have refused my request. my experience with them has been terrible. it blows my mind that they are willing to treat a customer such as myself this way - i have been there decades and have large deposits in my accounts. if they are deciding to treat small business owners this way, then perhaps small business owners should consider different banks.   \n",

Eventually I was told it was because I was deemed high risk because fraud had occurred 5 times. OK. I can accept being dropped for being the victim. But I was never notified.

And to take away my online access to my account also made it so I couldnt see my statement, pay my bill, and use my reward points. \\nCapital One cut me off without notification. This put me at risk.

One day I made a full payment on the wrong account before the due date but did not notice the error it until the statement came with late fees and interest charges. I called the costumer service and transferred payment from one to the other. They apparently waived the late fee but not the interest and the next month late fee on unpaid interest shows up. I called again and rep refused to hear my explanation and refused to connect me to a supervisor. Later on a second attempt they agreed to connect me to a supervisor but was on hold for 20 min. Meanwhile, every month I am getting a late fee charge for an interest that should not have been charged at all. They are only interested in taking your money, not in customer satisfaction.   \n",

       "22767                         recently, all of my remaining student loans went into forbearance, which i did not request. i am totally aware this is due to the current covid-19 situation, and i appreciate that this is helping those who are struggling ; however, i am actually quite fortunate right now *knocks on wood* and would much rather continue to pay. the 0 % interest rate is great though ; i am certainly not complaining about that. i contacted myfedloan, and they said they would fix it, but that has not happened. 1. i certainly do not want forbearance mentioned on any of my credit reports ; being my fico score is 830+, it would make me look risky as if i could not afford my {$200.00} ish payment, which is not a problem for me whatsoever. 2. the loans without forbearance with regular on-time payments are scheduled to be paid in-full by me at or about the end of xxxx, and with forbearance this will either extend them into xxxx or make a lump-sum due neither of which i really desire. background information : i am nine ( 9 ) years into re-payment having never been late and never missed a payment. i actually have enough to pay all 5 of the loans off in-full, but i would rather keep paying as i was paying before covid-19.i do want to keep the 0 % though.   \n",

Eventually I was told it was because I was deemed high risk because fraud had occurred 5 times. OK. I can accept being dropped for being the victim. But I was never notified. Shutting down my card also left me without cell phone activation. And to take away my online access to my account also made it so I couldnt see my statement, pay my bill, and use my reward points. \\nCapital One cut me off without notification. This put me at risk.

One day I made a full payment on the wrong account before the due date but did not notice the error it until the statement came with late fees and interest charges. I called the costumer service and transferred payment from one to the other. They apparently waived the late fee but not the interest and the next month late fee on unpaid interest shows up. I called again and rep refused to hear my explanation and refused to connect me to a supervisor. Later on a second attempt they agreed to connect me to a supervisor but was on hold for 20 min. Meanwhile, every month I am getting a late fee charge for an interest that should not have been charged at all. They are only interested in taking your money, not in customer satisfaction.   \n",

       "22767                         recently, all of my remaining student loans went into forbearance, which i did not request. i am totally aware this is due to the current covid-19 situation, and i appreciate that this is helping those who are struggling ; however, i am actually quite fortunate right now *knocks on wood* and would much rather continue to pay. the 0 % interest rate is great though ; i am certainly not complaining about that. i contacted myfedloan, and they said they would fix it, but that has not happened. 1. i certainly do not want forbearance mentioned on any of my credit reports ; being my fico score is 830+, it would make me look risky as if i could not afford my {$200.00} ish payment, which is not a problem for me whatsoever. 2. the loans without forbearance with regular on-time payments are scheduled to be paid in-full by me at or about the end of xxxx, and with forbearance this will either extend them into xxxx or make a lump-sum due neither of which i really desire. background information : i am nine ( 9 ) years into re-payment having never been late and never missed a payment. i actually have enough to pay all 5 of the loans off in-full, but i would rather keep paying as i was paying before covid-19.i do want to keep the 0 % though.   \n",

       "37440  I was using a Citibank or Citicards credit card, Citi DiamXXXX Preferred Card for my New York XXXX XXXX membership ( the club has been closed due to the Carona Virus lockdown since XX/XX/2020 ) and the monthly fee for my passport membership was {$54.00}. New York XXXX continued to charge in spite of their clubs closing and I called Citicards repeatedly to dispute the charge. The first time I called was XX/XX/2020. I was told by Citicards that they would look into the dispute and credit my account for the amount of {$54.00}. That never happened. Instead for the charge ( which I had disputed ) due XX/XX/2020 they added a late fee and began calling me leaving messages to collect a debt. I went in and spoke with a bank XXXX at Citibank XXXX XXXX ( that's XXXX NY on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX who spoke with Citicards on my behalf. He said he was able to get the dispute reinstated and get rid of the late charge and that he was then closing the account. He asked me if I wanted him to shred the card and I said yes. He shredded it. He told me he was ordering new cards be sent to me. But Citicards continued calling and sending mail to \" collect the debt ''. There was never any communication to me by Citibank about the dispute I had opened. I called Citicards yet again on or about XX/XX/XXXX. They assured me that the first person I had spoken with there didn't follow the proper steps to open a dispute and that the calls and e-mails would eventually stop. On that call Citicards also agreed to open up a dispute about the next charge by NY XXXX XXXX which was due on XX/XX/XXXX. Citicards continues to call and send e-mail about the debt daily with no communication with me regarding either of the disputes I've opened up, or at least the disputes which Citicards has told me on the phone that they've opened up.   \n",

       "37440  i was using a citibank or citicards credit card, citi diamxxxx preferred card for my new york xxxx xxxx membership ( the club has been closed due to the carona virus lockdown since xx/xx/2020 ) and the monthly fee for my passport membership was {$54.00}. new york xxxx continued to charge in spite of their clubs closing and i called citicards repeatedly to dispute the charge. the first time i called was xx/xx/2020. i was told by citicards that they would look into the dispute and credit my account for the amount of {$54.00}. that never happened. instead for the charge ( which i had disputed ) due xx/xx/2020 they added a late fee and began calling me leaving messages to collect a debt. i went in and spoke with a bank xxxx at citibank xxxx xxxx ( that's xxxx ny on xxxx xxxx, xxxx xxxx who spoke with citicards on my behalf. he said he was able to get the dispute reinstated and get rid of the late charge and that he was then closing the account. he asked me if i wanted him to shred the card and i said yes. he shredded it. he told me he was ordering new cards be sent to me. but citicards continued calling and sending mail to \" collect the debt ''. there was never any communication to me by citibank about the dispute i had opened. i called citicards yet again on or about xx/xx/xxxx. they assured me that the first person i had spoken with there didn't follow the proper steps to open a dispute and that the calls and e-mails would eventually stop. on that call citicards also agreed to open up a dispute about the next charge by ny xxxx xxxx which was due on xx/xx/xxxx. citicards continues to call and send e-mail about the debt daily with no communication with me regarding either of the disputes i've opened up, or at least the disputes which citicards has told me on the phone that they've opened up.   \n",
